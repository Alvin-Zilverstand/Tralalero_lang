# Tralalero Lang

Benvenuto! Welcome to Tralalero Lang, the most whimsical and brain-tickling programming language inspired by the finest Italian-flavored brainrot.

## Getting Started

To run a Tralalero program, you need to have Rust installed. Then, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- <file_name>.tralla
```

## Syntax

A Tralalero program must start with `Tralalero Tralala` and end with `Bombardiro Crocodilo`.

## Keywords

### `Tralalero Tralala`

This is the entry point of the program. It must be the first line of your code.

### `Bombardiro Crocodilo`

This is the exit point of the program. It must be the last line of your code.

### `Matteeeo <value>`

This command prints a value to the console. The value can be a string literal (enclosed in double quotes) or a variable.

### `Biscottini <variable_name> <value>`

This command declares a variable and assigns a value to it. The value can be a string literal or a number.

### `Pinguino Arrabiato Fruti <number>`

This command creates a loop that repeats a block of code a specified number of times. The block of code must be enclosed in `{` and `}` on separate lines.

Example:
```tralalero
Pinguino Arrabiato Fruti 3
{
  Matteeeo "Hello"
}
```

### `Chimpanzini <variable_name> <operand1> <operator> <operand2>`

This command performs an arithmetic operation and stores the result in a variable. The supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

Example:
```tralalero
Biscottini x 10
Biscottini y 5
Chimpanzini result x + y
Matteeeo result // prints 15
```

### `Tung Tung Tung <operand1> <operator> <operand2>`

This command executes a block of code if a condition is true. The supported operators are `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

Example:
```tralalero
Biscottini x 10
Tung Tung Tung x > 5
{
  Matteeeo "x is greater than 5"
}
```

## Ciao!
